# ranking-scrabble-words
The objective of these functions is twofold:

(1) to create a leaderboard of the 100 highest scoring words in English based on the words in the wordlist.txt file.
Words should be ordered in descending order with the highest scoring first. If several words have the same score they
should be ordered alphabetically.
(2) to identify all the valid words that can be created from a supplied starting String of random letters. The length
of the random starting String may vary but could be assumed to be in the range of 5-15 characters. Again, words should
be ordered in descending order with the highest scoring first. If several words have the same score they should be
ordered alphabetically.
